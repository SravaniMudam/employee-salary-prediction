# Employee Salary Prediction 

This project predicts employee salaries based on various features such as department, position, gender, education, and performance score. It was built as part of the Edunet Foundation IBM AI/ML internship.

---

## Objective
To analyze employee data and build a machine learning model that predicts employee salaries accurately using regression algorithms.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python 
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest Regressor)
- Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)

---

## Steps Involved
1. Load and clean the dataset
2. Handle missing values and encode categorical data
3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Train-test split
5. Build and train a Random Forest model
6. Evaluate model using R² score and MSE
7. Visualize results (correlation, predictions)

## Files in this Project
- `main.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with full implementation
- `HRDataset_v14.csv` – Employee dataset
- `README.md` – Project overview (this file)

---
## Result
- Achieved a good prediction score using Random Forest
- Visualized salary trends by department and job role
- Compared predicted salaries with actual values

---

## Conclusion
The model helps understand salary trends and predicts employee compensation accurately. It can be helpful in HR analytics and decision-making.
